PROBLEM STATEMENT

Planning and booking a comprehensive travel package can be a complex and time-consuming process for travelers. The current market lacks a unified platform that seamlessly integrates flights, hotels, activities, and car rentals into personalized packages tailored to individual preferences. Travelers often face the following challenges:

Fragmented Booking Process: Users must visit multiple websites or apps to book flights, accommodations, activities, and car rentals separately, leading to a disjointed and inefficient experience.

Lack of Personalization: Existing platforms fail to effectively leverage user preferences, past bookings, and feedback to provide tailored travel recommendations.

Cumbersome Search Experience: Finding and selecting the right accommodations, activities, and car rentals near specific locations can be overwhelming and time-consuming.

Inadequate Integration: Limited integration between various travel services results in a lack of cohesive travel packages, making it difficult for users to plan their trips seamlessly.

Static Recommendations: Traditional travel booking platforms offer static recommendations that do not dynamically adjust based on real-time data or user interactions.
